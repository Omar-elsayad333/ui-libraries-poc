## 🧪 Goal

Evaluate and compare two UI libraries (**MUI** and **shadcn/ui**) to determine which is more suitable for our project in terms of development experience, design flexibility, performance, and maintainability.

---

## 📦 Setup & Integration

| Feature | MUI | shadcn/ui |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installation Steps | `npm install @mui/material` | `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` |
| Tailwind Support | ❌ (Not native) | ✅ Built-in |
| Next.js Compatibility | ✅ | ✅ |
| Theming System | Emotion + ThemeProvider | Tailwind config + classnames |

---

## 🧩 Component Comparison

| Component | MUI Implementation Notes | shadcn/ui Implementation Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Button | Predefined variants, some customization | Highly customizable with Tailwind |
| Form + Input | Requires Formik or other libs | Works well with React Hook Form |
| Table/List | Complex API, but feature-rich (Filters and sort)
But you will need to match it’s design if you will use it’s built in table filters or sorting | Simpler, more control via raw JSX + styles
(Need more customization but a log of flexibility ) |
| Theme Switcher | Manual logic with context | Easy Tailwind-based toggle |

---

## 🎨 Styling & Customization

| Feature | MUI | shadcn/ui |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom Styles | Via `sx` or styled API (+100 line) | Direct Tailwind classes (-40 line) |
| Dark Mode | Requires custom setup | Native support via Tailwind |
| Style Consistency | Material Design enforced | Fully design-agnostic |

---

## 🛡️ Accessibility (a11y)

Both libraries offer good accessibility support:

- **MUI**: Built-in keyboard support
- **shadcn/ui**: Uses **Radix UI**, which is a highly accessible component library (Also Keyboard support)

---

## 📊 Bundle Size & Performance

| Metric | MUI | shadcn/ui |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bundle Size | ~70–100 KB (minified) | ~20–40 KB (varies) |
| Performance | Slightly heavier due to Emotion | Lightweight (Tailwind + Radix) |
| Build | includes all components in build version | includes only used components |

---

## 🧠 Developer Experience

| Aspect | MUI | shadcn/Ui |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Learning Curve | Moderate (need to learn MUI system) | Easy if you're familiar with Tailwind |
| Documentation Quality | ✅ Very detailed and extensive | 📈 Growing, improving steadily |
| Customization Flexibility | Medium (theming system can be complex) | High (utility-first styling) |
| Community/Support | Large, mature community | Newer but active and growing |

---

## ✅ Summary & Recommendation

### ✅ Our Recommendation: Shadcn 👀

### Reasons:

- Easier to customize and match our design system
- Better Tailwind/Next.js integration
- Smaller bundle and better performance
- Faster development time and flexibility
